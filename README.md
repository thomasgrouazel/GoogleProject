# Google Project
A Google Homepage project and an explanation on how to use the incredible Font Awesome.<br>

## FONT AWESOME 
This project is used to get font awesome working into your html file.<br>

## PREREQUISITES 
This project requires HTML5 and CSS3 set up.<br>

## TYPES OF ICONS OFFERED 
Any type of icons can be used, as much as they are free on the font awesome website.<br>

## INSTALLATION 
No installation needed! That’s great, isn’t it? <br>
Warning: we won’t explain all the Google Homepage Project, only the use of Font awesome in this first readme.md. Don’t get lost in all the code, just look at the right lines.<br>

## USAGE 
First step, go to Font awesome website: <https://fontawesome.com> <br>
Then get the link that allowed you to use their icons in your HTML code:<br>
<br>

<br>
And put this link into your HTML head:<br>

<br>
Okay, now you can use their icons. In HTML5 code you have two very useful options to get an icon working: link and SVG. Here you’ll have the easiest one, link. Stay in Font Awesome website and find a free icon that you want to use, like this one: <br>

Do you see <i class=”fas fa-search”></i> ? It’s the good link! <br>
<br>
We used different icons in our project but it’s the same process. The best example is a button, clear and simple. To get your icon inside the button you need to do that at first:<br>
<br>
![plot](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/900265852904030218/910447012741255168/tuto13.PNG)<br>

Just between the two <> </> of your button. <br>
And then, you use the CSS the way you want to shape the button. Here we wanted this:<br>
<br>
![plot](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/900265852904030218/910447093829750814/tuto17.PNG)<br>

The result you asked. Good you’re still awake! Here you are:<br>

<br>
<br>
The two on the right parts are your buttons without any text, only one icon each.<br>

Another example? You’re a curious one… but here we are:<br>

In a search bar! Yes, it’s possible. Font Awesome is… Awesome ehe. There you go for the CSS part:<br>

Beautiful ? Yeah we know but thanks, you’re a kind person. <br>

Here a Codepen.io link to help you try new icons:<br> https://codepen.io/LostinZCity/pen/RwZEQxr<br>

Best of all, you can do it yourself now! Coding is all about free and open data, so let’s go and experiment as much as you want. Glad we can help you a little, see you soon ;-) <br>
